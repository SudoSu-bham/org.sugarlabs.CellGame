# Cell Game Activity Flatpak

Aliens have abducted two each of six species from Earth. All are currently held captive on a spaceship returning to the alien home-planet, with each species in a different cell. The player's goal is to have one of each type of species escape to the center of the ship. A group of unique individuals, one for each species, will give the player the strength they need to overpower the alien guards and release everyone.
